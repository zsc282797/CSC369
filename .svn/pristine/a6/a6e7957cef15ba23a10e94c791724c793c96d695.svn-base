The most difficult debug that I figured was after I changed my design to a black/white list mode seeking the bonus marks. I was experience a system bug which would cause a kernel panic with the error : BUG: unable to handle kernel parsing. After excessive research and reading the kernel dump, I finally figured that it was caused by a mistaken ordering of arguments when calling the list operation function. 

This took me many hours to figure and made me to recode the program many more times (the 140 revision self explains). It was a relief at the end but also a warning that I should have API reference by my side all the time instead of taking guessing.

Everything is working by the test provided and also my test. I have played around with several system calls and read the system logs and found them accords to expectation.
